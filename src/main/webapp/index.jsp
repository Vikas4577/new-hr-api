  <p>The acronym CI/CD has a few different meanings. The "CI" in CI/CD always refers to continuous integration, which is an automation process for developers. Successful CI means new code changes to an app are regularly built, tested, and merged to a shared repository. Itâ€™s a solution to the problem of having too many branches of an app in development at once that might conflict with each other. </p>
